# Wild_Fire_Analysis
This repository contains data, code, and documentation for a study on the brightness levels of Canadian wildfires during day and night. Using EDA and advanced visualization in R, we explore temporal and seasonal trends to enhance wildfire detection and response. Key findings and visualizations are included for improved wildfire management.
